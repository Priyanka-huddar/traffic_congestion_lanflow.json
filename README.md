# AI-Driven Early Warning System for Traffic Congestion Hotspots 🚦

## 📌 Project Overview
Urban traffic congestion is a growing challenge due to increasing vehicle density, roadworks, and unexpected disruptions such as accidents or weather changes. Most existing traffic management systems are reactive and respond only after congestion becomes severe.

This project proposes an **AI-Driven Early Warning System** that proactively identifies potential traffic congestion hotspots before they escalate. The system uses an **agentic AI architecture built with LangFlow and IBM Granite**, supported by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide intelligent, explainable, and planning-level advisories to traffic authorities.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traffic congestion hotspots often develop gradually due to increasing demand, roadworks, or external disruptions. Existing traffic systems lack early warning mechanisms that can identify congestion trends in advance. As a result, authorities are unable to plan proactive interventions, leading to severe congestion, increased travel time, fuel wastage, and environmental pollution.

An intelligent system is required to continuously monitor traffic data, detect early warning signs of congestion, and assist traffic authorities with planning-level advisories.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The proposed system uses a **multi-agent AI framework** where each agent performs a specialized role:

- Continuous monitoring of real-time and historical traffic data
- Early detection of congestion risks using trend and deviation analysis
- Generation of explainable alerts and planning-level recommendations
- Use of RAG to align advisories with standard congestion management and transportation planning guidelines

## 🧠 System Architecture (Agents)

### 1. Traffic Data Analysis Agent
- Processes vehicle speed, traffic density, travel time
- Incorporates external factors such as weather conditions and incidents
- Uses IBM Granite LLM for semantic pattern understanding

### 2. Congestion Risk Detection Agent
- Compares real-time traffic data with historical and seasonal trends
- Detects early signs of congestion buildup
- Flags potential hotspots before they become critical

### 3. Alert & Planning Assistant (Assistive Only)
- Issues early warning alerts to traffic authorities
- Provides planning-level advisories such as rerouting suggestions or signal timing recommendations
- Operates with a human-in-the-loop approach (no automated control)
